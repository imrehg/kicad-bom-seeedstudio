# kicad-bom-seeedstudio

A [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org) Bill-of-Materials (BOM) plugin to follow
[SeeedStudio](https://www.seedstudio.com)'s [Fusion PCBA](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html)
assembly service's [template](https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/assets/file/fusion/bom_template_2016-08-18.csv),
that is:

```
Part/Designator,Manufacture Part Number/Seeed SKU,Quantity
C1,RHA,1
"D1,D2",CC0603KRX7R9BB102,2
```

Note: Components with `DNM` attribute will be excluded by default.

## How to use it

This plugin is set up to use the KiCad schematic's part data as it is
provided in Seeed Studio's Open Parts Library (OPL) collection for KiCad. That is:

* OPL parts have a `SKU` value defined, that's the default value to export
* If there's no `SKU`, then a `MPN` field is searched and exported
* If neither is found for a part, at the end of the export a warning is issued

Thus for every part either set a `SKU` with the OPL part number or an `MPN`
value.

Add the plugin in eeschema, set it a name, then use it with `Generate`:
